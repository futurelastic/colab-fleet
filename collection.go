//
// # Why it is on the envelope and not a second call
//
// A mirror is a snapshot plus every event after it. The cursor was readable
// before this existed — from the health endpoint — but only as a SEPARATE
// request, and neither ordering is safe: read it after the listing and
// anything that happened in between is lost with nothing to notice, read it
// before and you are relying on an accident nobody wrote down. One response
// carrying both closes the question.
//
// # The cursor is stamped BEFORE the enumeration, deliberately
//
// So a snapshot may already contain changes newer than the cursor it carries,
// and replaying from that cursor re-applies them. That overlap is the point.
// Applying an event twice to a mirror keyed by session id changes nothing;
// missing one leaves a mirror that is wrong forever and cannot tell. The
// design is arranged to produce the recoverable failure — the same asymmetry
// §7.3 uses to insist a gap be announced rather than silently skipped.
//
// # Absent means "not a resume point", which is not the same as zero
//
// A service only advances its sequence while it is actually observing a
// driver; with nothing subscribed, the cursor is frozen while the world moves.
// A number handed out then would look resumable and would silently skip
// everything that happened before the first subscription. So it is omitted
// instead, and §5.7 applies as it always does: absence is a real answer, and a
// client that finds none must subscribe first and list second.
