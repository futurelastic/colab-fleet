// ClosedSession is the record a service keeps of one session after it ended
// — a tombstone, read through GET /v1/sessions/closed (api-http.md §3.2).
//
// # Why a service keeps these at all
//
// The live list answers "what is running"; the event feed answers "what
// changed while I was watching". Neither answers "which sessions ran here in
// the last N days, and when did each end" — the feed's window is in memory,
// is not persisted, and only advances while something is subscribed. A
// consumer that wants that answer would otherwise have to keep its own copy
// of session state, which is exactly the second copy of the truth this
// service exists to make unnecessary.
//
// This is deliberately much smaller than a persisted event window: one record
// per ended session, kept for a bounded retention period, carrying only the
// metadata the live record already carried. Content is never included.
//
// # closedAt is a bound, and ClosedBy says which kind
//
// A session closed through this service ends at a moment the service
// observed, and closedAt is that moment. A session that ended on its own —
// the process exited, a human killed it from a terminal — is learned about
// the next time the service reads its machine completely: from a live event
// stream, a listing, or its own start-up sweep. Its closedAt is when that
// absence was OBSERVED, and the true end lies somewhere after LastSeenAt and
// no later than closedAt. The two are reported side by side rather than one
// being presented as the other (§5.2: inference is never presented as
// observation).

	// the file on that machine, or a future issue adds a route for it.

	// itself failed) — absent evidence, never an empty string standing in
