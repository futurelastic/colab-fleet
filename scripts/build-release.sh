#!/bin/sh
# Cross-compile muster for every supported platform and write a SHA256SUMS
# file beside the binaries. This is the build half of a GitHub Release (#241);
# .github/workflows/release-binaries.yml calls it and attaches the output.
#
# USAGE
#
#   scripts/build-release.sh OUTDIR [VERSION]
#
# Run it from inside the checkout to build — the CURRENT directory is the
# source tree, not the directory this script lives in. That split is what lets
# the workflow build a tag that predates this script: it checks the tag out
# next to a checkout of the current tooling and runs the tooling's copy here.
#
#   OUTDIR    where the binaries and SHA256SUMS land (created if absent).
#   VERSION   the release tag being built. Defaults to `git describe` of the
#             tree, exactly as scripts/deploy.sh stamps it. A version that is
#             not a "v<digit>..." tag is refused: build.go reports anything
#             else as unstamped, so a binary built under it would answer
#             `--version` with something other than the tag it is published
#             under — the one check a downloader can make.
#
# Output files are named muster-<version>-<os>-<arch>. The name is part of the
# contract: SHA256SUMS lists these exact names, so `shasum -a 256 -c` run next
# to a downloaded file verifies it without anyone renaming anything.
