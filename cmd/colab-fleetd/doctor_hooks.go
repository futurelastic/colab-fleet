// hooks.pre-commit — will a commit made in this clone be scanned for secrets?
// (colab-fleet #201)
//
// # Why a row, and why here
//
// The secret guard that runs before a value is published is
// .githooks/pre-commit, and it is switched on by `git config core.hooksPath`,
// which lives in one clone's own .git/config. Nothing in the repository can
// carry it to another clone, so a clone that never ran .githooks/install.sh
// commits with no scan in front of it and says nothing: measured, a commit
// quoting a key-shaped value went through in silence in such a clone, where
// the scanner run by hand would have refused it. #199 ruled that a branch push
// is not scanned by CI *because* the hook is the guard that works first — so
// the hook being absent is not a small thing to leave unreported.
//
// Every other row here answers for the installation. This one answers for the
// clone doctor is run from, which is a different object: an installed
// service machine usually has no clone at all, and one that does may hold it
// only to build from. So the row is answered only when the working directory
// is inside a clone of this repository, and is `skip` everywhere else — an
// adopter running doctor on a service host sees a skipped row, never a
// finding about a repository they do not have.
//
// # What it asks
//
// Not "is core.hooksPath set" — that reads one spelling of the answer. It asks
// git which file it WOULD run as the pre-commit hook (`rev-parse --git-path`),
// which already folds in a relative or absolute hooksPath, a linked worktree,
// and a global setting, then compares that file with this repository's tracked
// hook, and checks the executable bit git requires before it will run a hook
// at all. Then it checks the hook's own dependency: with no gitleaks on PATH
// the hook prints a notice and lets the commit through, so a `pass` that
// ignored it would be the silent-verify shape this command exists to end.
//
// # Why warn, never fail (ADR 160, ADR 201)
//
// A clone kept only to read or to build from legitimately has no hook, and the
// hook is no dependency of the service. So the state is one that is right
// somewhere, and the row names why it might be wrong. The exit code is
// unchanged.
//
// It reads the invoking shell's git configuration and PATH, like every other
// row reads the invoking shell's environment. A commit made from an editor
// with a barer PATH can still find no gitleaks; the row says what THIS shell
// would do.
