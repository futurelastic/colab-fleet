// ConversationRef locates the record the RUNTIME keeps of a session's
// conversation — the identifier it filed that record under, which is not any
// identifier this service assigns.
//
// # Why this is worth a field, independent of ever reading the record
//
// Every local source in this service ultimately quotes the process's own
// announcement about itself. The screen is what the runtime chose to paint;
// the status is this driver's reading of that paint; a delivery receipt is the
// same surface read twice. When the thing being asked is the thing that is
// broken, all of those agree and all of them are wrong together — measured
// here at its sharpest: 51 of 52 sessions read healthy while the account
// underneath every one of them was refusing work.
//
// The runtime writes its conversation record for its OWN purposes, unasked,
// without knowing anyone is watching. That makes it an independent witness
// rather than another echo, and it is the first source in this service that is
// not the process describing itself. Knowing WHICH record belongs to a session
// is therefore worth having even if nothing ever opens it: two sessions
// claiming one record, or a live session with no record at all, are facts about
// identity that no amount of screen reading can produce.
//
// # Three states, because absence and failure are different answers (§5.7)
//
//	field absent (nil)      nobody looked — no record store on this substrate,
//	                        or lookup is not configured. Not a claim about the
//	                        session.
//	Known false + Evidence  we looked and could not tell, and the evidence says
//	                        why. This is a real answer.
//	Known true  + Source    we can name the record, and Source says how that
//	                        was learned.
//
// The middle state is not hypothetical. Measured over a live fleet, one session
// in thirteen had several equally possible records and had to be refused.
//
// # Why Source exists at all
//
// Because a caller that cannot tell a read value from a MATCHED one will
// corroborate against a guess and believe it is evidence — which is this type's
// own motivating failure, arriving one level up. §2.3 already separates a
// structured read from a screen guess (Confidence), and §4.3 separates a peer's
// own declaration from a floor nobody confirmed (CapabilitySource). This is the
// third instance of the same problem, so it takes the same shape rather than
// inventing a fourth.

	// Known is false when a lookup happened and produced no answer. It is

	// Evidence is prose for humans, present in BOTH the resolved and the
	// unresolved case — unlike the Known/Reason pairs elsewhere in this
	// package, where a reason only exists for a "no".
	//
	// A "yes" needs prose here too, because two derivations of equal
	// confidence do not exist: "the only record carrying this session's name"
	// and "the only one left after two others were ruled out" are different
	// strengths of the same answer, and a caller weighing whether to act on
	// the identifier is entitled to know which it got.

	// Do not parse it (§2.3). Branch on Known and Source.
	Evidence string `json:"evidence"`

// ConversationSource is how an identifier was learned. A closed set, decoded
// strictly, for the same reason as Status and Confidence: an unrecognised

//
// Nothing writes ConversationCaptured today. It is defined anyway because this
// service federates, peers have already been caught running different vintages
// of this code, and a strict decoder makes a NEW member a wire break for
// whichever peer is older — it would reject the whole session rather than one
// field. Naming the second value now costs a line; naming it later costs the
// incident that Build exists to prevent.
