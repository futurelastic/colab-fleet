// The event plane: §7.3's cursor and epoch, §13's multiplexing, and the
// retention that makes a gap announceable instead of silent.
//
// # Who assigns what
//
// A driver produces events and leaves Cursor and Epoch unset, because §7.3
// assigns them per *service instance* and two drivers under one service must
// not mint competing sequences. The hub stamps them on the way through. That
// split is why a driver's event is not directly deliverable and why this type
// exists at all.
//
// # Retention exists so a gap can be announced
//
// A subscriber reconnects with the last cursor it saw. If that cursor is older
// than what is retained, or the epoch differs because this service restarted,
// the subscriber is told `resync_required` rather than quietly resumed from
// the oldest event still held. §7.3 is explicit about why: silently resuming
// produces a subscriber that believes it has a complete history and does not.
// Announced gaps are recoverable; silent ones are not.
//
// # Watching costs what the subscribers asked for
//
// The hub keeps ONE driver subscription, not one per client — two streams over
// the same driver would produce two events for one change, with different
// cursors, and deliver both to everyone.
//
// Its filter is the union of the active clients' filters, recomputed whenever
// a client arrives or leaves. That is D4's lesson applied one level up: if
// every client names the sessions it cares about, the union names them too and
// the driver attaches one connection per named session. If any client asks
// descriptively — a directory prefix, or nothing at all — the union widens to
// everything, because there is no honest way to serve a description for less.
// The cost of a vague subscriber is paid by the machine it subscribes to, and
// that is worth knowing rather than hiding.

const defaultRetention = 512

// defaultLinger is how long the driver-side stream stays up after the last
// subscriber leaves.
//
// # Why an idle stream is worth paying for
//
// Tearing down on the last departure looks like the frugal choice, and for a
// resident SSE subscriber it never fires. For the long-poll transport it fires
// on EVERY cycle: a poll returns, its subscriber is released, the stream is
// cancelled, and the next poll re-opens it — whereupon the driver takes a fresh
// baseline reading and absorbs everything that changed in between. That is not
// a slow feed, it is a silent hole per cycle, and nothing anywhere can notice
// it afterwards.
//
// The window is a compromise with §5.5's "an idle fleet costs nothing": one
// minute is long enough to bridge a poll cycle and a client restart, short
// enough that a machine nobody is watching stops holding connections to a
// multiplexer other tools share.
