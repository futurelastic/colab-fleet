// §6 requirement 4: "Log every remote-originated mutation — actor, verb,
// target, outcome. This is the audit trail that replaces 'it could only ever
// have been me.'"
//
// That requirement was unimplementable until principals existed. A shared
// token can name an address, and an audit line reading "something at
// 10.x.y.z closed a session" answers where from while never answering who —
// which is the only question an audit trail is asked.
//
// Denials are logged as well as grants. A refused attempt is the more
// interesting line of the two: permitted work is expected, and a pattern of
// refusals is the first sign that a credential is somewhere it should not be.

// actorOf composes the audit actor through the SAME path that builds
// Request.Caller, rather than reaching for Principal.Name directly.
//
// The first version did reach for the name, and a live relayed mutation logged
// actor="<the relaying machine>" — losing the assertion that exists precisely
// so the peer can record who asked. Two places deriving "who is acting" is one
// too many, and the one nobody reads during a test is the one that drifts.

// auditWriter records the status a handler actually produced, so the audit
// line can state the OUTCOME rather than the authorization decision.
//
// The first version logged before running the handler, so every attempt read
// `outcome=permitted`. Four discard attempts in one minute — two refused with
// 409, one performed, one an idempotent retry — produced four identical lines.
// §6 requirement 4 asks for "actor, verb, target, outcome", and an audit trail
// that cannot distinguish a refusal from a destruction is not one.

// routeOf names the HTTP route a request actually matched — the method and
// path pattern ServeMux resolved it against (e.g. "POST
// /v1/machines/{machine}/sessions/{id}/input") — a fact the standard library
// itself records when the mux dispatches, not something a caller supplies.
//
// This is what colab-fleet#105 asked for: input and respond both require
// GrantSend, so verb=send alone cannot tell them apart in the audit trail,
// and colab-fleet#82 made that collision the ordinary case rather than a
// rare one — its endorsed reply-delivery convention has a dispatched worker
// call input on the requester's own session, so a delivered reply and a
// respond-to-a-dialog call now differ only by route, never by grant.
//
// It does NOT recover every collision #105 names. A delivered reply and an
// ordinary operator follow-up both match POST .../input — same method, same
// pattern — so no amount of route detail tells those two apart; #82's ADR
// already declined to add a caller-supplied marker for exactly that
// distinction ("proposed against a harm nothing has yet caused"), and this
// function does not reopen that. Whatever already distinguishes them does so
// through actorOf, when the two calls authenticate as different principals —
// unaffected by, and not a substitute for, this field.
