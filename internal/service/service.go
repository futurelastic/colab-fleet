// existence-first resolution possible at all: a version of this function
// that never saw the id (the shape this had before colab-fleet issue #60)
// had nothing to check registered drivers against, and could only guess or
// refuse.
//
//   - machine == a configured peer: that peer's single remote driver
//     handles it — the peer resolves its own runtimes locally, and this
//     service never recurses into asking the peer to disambiguate (§13.1).
//     The machine-local default configured here NEVER reaches this branch:
//     applying it to a peer would make one bare id mean different sessions
//     depending on which machine answered, exactly the fork §7.1's
//     (machine, id) addressing exists to prevent.
//
//   - machine == self, runtimeHint given: routes directly to that local
//     driver. The caller named its runtime; nothing here second-guesses it.
//
//   - machine == self, runtimeHint empty, exactly one local driver
//     registered: that driver, unambiguously — the case that held for this
//     whole repository's life before a second local driver existed to
//     register.
//
//   - machine == self, runtimeHint empty, more than one local driver
//     registered: EXISTENCE FIRST, DEFAULT AS TIEBREAK (colab-fleet #60).
//     A nonempty id is probed against every registered local driver's own
//     State() — ErrNoSuchSession is a driver's affirmative "I have never
//     had this id" (errors.go) — and:
//
//     exactly one driver affirms it     -> that driver, full stop,
//     REGARDLESS of the configured
//     default (guardrail 3: a default
//     naming runtime A must never
//     steer a bare id that plainly
//     belongs to runtime B into a
//     false not_found).
//     more than one driver affirms it   -> refused, naming every runtime
//     that claims the id. §5.4
//     already requires consensus
//     before acting on a recycled id;
//     two runtimes claiming the same
//     one is exactly that case, and it
//     is surfaced rather than
//     silently resolved.
//     any driver's probe is inconclusive
//     (fails for a reason other than
//     "never had this id") and nothing
//     else affirms it                   -> refused rather than guessed. An
//     inconclusive driver might be the
//     one actually holding the id, and
//     defaulting past it is the same
//     false-absence guardrail 3
//     forbids.
//     every driver affirmatively
//     confirms absence                  -> a genuine miss, the same shape
//     create's own ambiguous case has
//     (there is equally nothing here
//     to route TO) — falls to the
//     configured default, or
//     ErrAmbiguousSession absent one.
//
//     id == "" (create) skips the probe outright and goes straight to that
//     same genuine-miss handling: the configured default when ambiguous, or

// "this operation always fails here". Nothing on DriverCapabilities
// currently distinguishes a driver that answers from one that cannot
