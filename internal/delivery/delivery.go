// Package delivery is the seam between a local driver and the mechanism that
// actually puts a caller's text into a session (#180).
//
// A local driver owns everything that is a decision about the REQUEST — the
// per-session lock, sanitising, the runtime-syntax guard, contradictory flags,
// the sender label. A delivery module owns the MECHANISM: how the text reaches
// the session, how it is confirmed, and what is recorded when it strands.
// Callers of POST /input never see this seam: request bodies, outcomes and
// receipts are the driver's contract, unchanged by which module ran.
//
// # What exists today, and what is deliberately absent
//
// One module ships: the tmux driver's built-in terminal path. The interface is
// shaped so a later module is additive — a new implementation of Module, not a
// change to this package or to any caller. Discovery, a configuration switch
// and automatic fallback between modules are NOT here; they belong to the
// change that adds a second module, and building them against a single
// implementation would be guessing at requirements nobody has measured.
//
// # Why Delivery is a struct
//
// A later module may need facts this one does not (the session's process
// identity, say). A struct grows a field without breaking every
// implementation; a positional signature does not.
