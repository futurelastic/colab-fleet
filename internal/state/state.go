// Package state persists the small amount a colab-fleet service must remember
// across a restart.
//
// # Why any of this exists
//
// The service was entirely in-memory, and four separate-looking problems were
// the same problem:
//
//   - §10's idempotency keys died on restart, so a federated create retried
//     across an upgrade produced two agents in one working directory — the
//     exact disaster §10 exists to prevent, on a driver that correctly
//     declares supportsResume.
//   - §7.3's epoch changed on every start, so every subscriber resynced after
//     every upgrade. For a service meant to stay up, restart is routine, and
//     that made it maximally disruptive.
//   - A driver's own sightings vanished, so §5.4's weaker corroboration path
//     had nothing to compare against until something listed first.
//   - §12's reconciliation was structurally incapable of its own job. It
//     enumerates and classifies into adopted / orphaned / vanished — but with
//     no persisted records, EVERYTHING is orphaned by definition. It looked
//     implemented and could not make the distinction it exists to make.
//
// # Why files, and why this shape
//
// Zero dependencies is a standing decision, which rules out an embedded
// database. What is actually needed is small, rarely written, and read once at
// startup, so a JSON file per concern is not a compromise — it is the right
// size of mechanism, and an operator can read it during an incident.
//
// Writes are atomic: a temp file in the same directory, fsynced, then renamed
// over the target. A half-written state file is worse than a missing one,
// because a missing one is obviously absent while a truncated one parses as
// authoritative for whatever it happens to contain.
//
// A corrupt or unreadable file is reported, never silently replaced with a
// fresh empty one. Losing idempotency keys quietly is how the §10 disaster
// arrives dressed as a clean start.
