// The rename probe and its check (colab-fleet #227, split from #223 item 4).
//
// #222 built SyncTitle, which brings the runtime's OWN title to a session's
// new name by delivering "/rename <name>" the way a human would type it, and
// degrades honestly to `pending` when no custom-title transcript entry
// follows within its own submitConfirmWindow (4s, titlesync.go). What #222
// never measured — because its own probes only ever sent ordinary text, never
// a programmatic /rename — is whether the runtime writes that entry at all
// for THIS delivery shape, or merely takes longer than four seconds to. The
// production counter SyncTitle increments either way
// (title_sync.command_without_title) gives a live RATE, and a rate cannot
// tell "slow" apart from "never". This drives one real rename against a real
// session, the same two calls the service makes in the same order
// (internal/service/rename_title.go), and keeps reading the transcript for
// compatRenameWait — far past SyncTitle's own window — so the answer is
// measured against this candidate, not inferred from a counter.

// compatRenameWait bounds how long this probe keeps reading the transcript
// after delivering a programmatic rename. It is deliberately far longer than
// submitConfirmWindow (4s) — SyncTitle itself gives up after that — so a
// runtime that is merely slow to write the custom-title is not reported the
// same as one that never does.
