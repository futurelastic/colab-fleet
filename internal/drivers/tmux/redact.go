// RedactCapture is the mechanism this repository requires before any real
// pane capture may live in this PUBLIC repo's git history. See
// testdata/corpus/README.md for why a corpus exists at all and what it may
// hold; this file is how that boundary is enforced rather than trusted.
//
// It classifies each line of a capture independently into one of the
// shapes this package's own classifier reads — a rule, a spinner line, the
// composer's marker, a numbered prompt option, a known footer, the
// model/plan line, a usage-limit or turn-failure notice, the response
// bullet — and keeps ONLY the part of that line that is fixed runtime
// vocabulary or a structural marker. Everything else is replaced by a
// fixed placeholder that preserves nothing but leading indentation.
//
// # The default is DISCARD
//
// A line this function does not recognise is discarded, not kept. That is
// the entire design, stated once: a redactor that keeps by default has to
// be told about every way content can appear on a pane, and missing one is
// exactly how a testdata directory of real captures becomes a transcript
// store — a human glancing at each line and occasionally missing one,
// forever, in a repository that cannot un-publish a commit.
//
// Line-local classification is enough because the classifier's own
// positional logic (composerText's fencing check, parsePrompt's run of
// numbered options, usageLimit's and lastTurnFailed's live-tail window) is
// driven by which lines ARE rules, markers and options — never by what
// prose says. Redacting content within an already-shape-classified line
// changes nothing about which shape that line is, so every classify.go
// function that matters for a corpus's purpose reads a redacted screen
// exactly as it would read the real one.
//
// # Idempotent by construction
//
// Every branch below either returns its input unchanged (fixed runtime
// vocabulary needs no redacting) or returns one of a small set of FIXED
// placeholder tokens that do not themselves match any of the recognised
// shapes — so redacting an already-redacted line reproduces it exactly.
// TestCorpusIsFullyRedacted relies on exactly this property: it re-runs
// RedactCapture over every committed corpus screen and requires the output
// to be byte-identical to what is on disk. A committed fixture that is not
// a fixed point of this function is a fixture this function would still
// change — evidence that a human (or a bug) let something past it.
