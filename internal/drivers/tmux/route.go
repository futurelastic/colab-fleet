// This file is colab-fleet #184's routing layer: which path a send takes, what
// is counted about it, and the ledger that keeps one message from arriving
// twice when the two paths meet.
//
// # The rule the ledger exists to keep
//
// A send goes down ONE path. The inbox may decline before it has written a
// byte and the terminal then carries the message — that is a fallback, and it
// is safe because nothing was sent. Once ANY byte has reached the inbox the
// message may be in the receiver's hands, and from then on the same text must
// not be sent down the other path. Inside a single Send that is a matter of
// control flow. Across Sends it is not: a send that ends `unknown` invites its
// caller to try again, and the documented way to try again (`resumeIfStranded`)
// is a terminal operation. Left alone, a retry of an inbox `unknown` would
// paste the same text into the composer, and the receiver would take it twice.
//
// So every inbox write that could not be confirmed leaves an entry in a small
// ledger, and every Send consults it before it chooses a path. An entry is
// evidence about ONE delivery — the same text from the same sender to the same
// session — and lapses after strandedRetention, like a stranded record. It
// holds digests, never the message.
//
// The opposite direction needs no ledger of its own: a terminal send that
// could not be confirmed already leaves a stranded record (noteStranded), and a
// later send of the same text finds it (terminalUnconfirmed).

// deliveryKey identifies one delivery for the ledger. The text is the
// sanitised text the driver acts on; the sender is who the caller said it is
// (agent and session), in the label's normalised form, so a retry that repeats
// the same `from` matches and a message from a different sender does not. The
// relay declaration is part of the key because it changes the body that was
// written.
//
// The machine the request entered through is deliberately NOT part of the key
// (#191). The service stamps it, so it names where a request arrived and not who
// sent it, and it is exactly what changes when a caller retries: a client that
// fails over to the peer enters through a different machine with the same text
// and the same identity. Keyed on the label as the receiver sees it, that retry
// would miss the entry, and an inbox that then declined with nothing written
// would let the terminal carry the message a second time. The cost of leaving
// the machine out is on the safe side: two callers that give the same identity
// and send the same text to the same session inside the retention window are
// held as one, which reads as "not sent again" rather than as a duplicate.
//
// Whether the message carried a label at all stays in the key, so a sender that
// named nothing and was labelled by the service (which leaves only the machine,
// dropped above) is not confused with an unlabelled one — a human relay's words
// go to the terminal with no label and must never be held for an anonymous
// peer's identical text.
