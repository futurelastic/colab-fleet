// Reading the runtime's own record of a REFUSAL, rather than the screen it
// painted about one (#56).
//
// # What the record says, measured rather than assumed
//
// A refusal is not a distinct event type in the record. It is an ordinary
// `type: "assistant"` entry the runtime writes IN PLACE of a real reply, with
// four extra fields set: `isApiErrorMessage: true`, `error` (a closed set
// measured on a live fleet: "rate_limit", "server_error",
// "authentication_failed", "oauth_org_not_allowed"), `apiErrorStatus` (the
// HTTP status, when the failure came from one), and a `message.content[0].text`
// carrying the runtime's own prose — the SAME sentence the screen renders
// ("You've hit your session limit · resets 9:50pm (Asia/Saigon)" for
// `rate_limit`; "API Error: 529 Overloaded ... usually temporary — try again
// in a moment" for a retryable `server_error`).
//
// `rate_limit` is specifically the account-level condition §2.3 calls
// `quota_blocked`. The other three categories are turn failures of a
// different kind — real, worth `LastTurn`, but never `Quota`.
//
// # Written at the refusal, not deferred to some later completion
//
// Measured across sampled records: the `system/turn_duration` entry that
// closes out a turn lands one to five milliseconds after the error entry —
// the error entry effectively IS the turn's terminal write, not a fact
// buffered until later. A refusal that ends the session is therefore not at
// risk of going unrecorded, which was this issue's own "measurement first"
// worry.
//
// # No native retryable field
//
// There is nothing in the record that says "this is temporary" as a
// boolean — only the same prose the screen already carries. So this file
// does not invent a status-code-based inference (lastTurnFailed's own
// comment already explains why that would be the wrong move); it applies
// the SAME word rule (retryableWords) to the record's text instead of a
// live, window-bounded screen scan. The source moves; the rule does not.
