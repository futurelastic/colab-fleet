// Remembering what a create asked for and what became of it (colab-fleet
// #84, #85, #86), so a later listing — and the create response itself — can
// report what was APPLIED rather than only what was REQUESTED.
//
// # Why one record, not three
//
// #84 (a dropped pin reported as applied), #85 (a runtime-hosted surface
// with no field), and #86 (a create-time prompt with no delivery receipt)
// are three fields on the same Session, filled from the same create. A
// caller reading the 201 body and the first 200 body of one session must
// see the same answer for all three, and the only way to guarantee that is
// for both to be computed from the same stored fact — one write in Create,
// one read in List, not three parallel tables drifting independently.
//
// # Same shape as resumeIntentRecord, for the same reasons
//
// Durable when a state store is configured, in memory otherwise (honest for
// a throwaway instance); keyed on the session id with the cwd carried
// alongside for corroboration (§5.4: an id alone is recyclable); swept by
// age rather than kept forever, because a record nobody has checked in
// createRecordRetention is not evidence about a caller who is still
// watching — the same reasoning resumeIntentRecord's own sweep states.

// createRecordRetention bounds how long this driver remembers a create's own
// facts about itself. A prompt delivery ordinarily resolves within moments
// of creation, and a runtime surface registers shortly after — this only has
// to survive long enough for a caller to check, not forever. Matches
// resumeIntentRetention: both are "long enough for a realistic poll,
// bounded so an abandoned record does not grow the table without limit."
