//
// It exists because of a distinction #44 drew explicitly: a retry that
// silently clears a strand still needs to be COUNTED, or the rate — the
// actual signal, per #44's measurement of three consecutive strands on one
// busy machine — is laundered away the moment it stops being a failure. A
// one-off `log.Printf` at the call site would have recorded that this
// happened; it would not have given anything a number to read later, and
// #44 asks for a counter, not a line that scrolls off.
//
// This is deliberately the smallest thing that satisfies that: a name and a
// count, nothing wired to an HTTP surface yet. #9 ("the service cannot see
// itself") already describes the larger shape this is one piece of, and
// names its own reason for staying unscheduled — no corpus yet to compare a
// surface against. Building that surface here, for one caller's two
// counters, would be answering a question #9 has not asked yet. What #44
// owes #9 is a registry the next fact can join without a new struct field
// and a new accessor — only a new name — and that is what this is.
