// colab-fleet #183: `colab-fleetd compat`.
//
// # What this is
//
// A check of a candidate build of the agent runtime against the assumptions
// this driver makes about it. The driver does not call an API — it reads a
// terminal UI and a few files the runtime writes, none of which is a published
// contract — so a new runtime release can change any of it, and the first sign
// is a fleet that has quietly stopped delivering or classifying. This asks
// before the fleet takes the build.
//
// # Why it lives in this package
//
// Almost everything a check needs is unexported here: the classifier, the
// composer reader, the transcript and process-record readers, the command
// builder. Exporting ~25 of them for one caller would permanently widen the
// driver's API and invite other code to depend on classifier internals. So the
// checks sit beside the code they exercise and this file exports exactly two
// names: CompatOptions and RunCompat. The report contract itself — types,
// catalogue, runner, exit codes — is in internal/compat, which imports nothing
// from this repository.
//
// The command only reports. It never installs, pins, switches or promotes a
// build; that decision belongs to whoever reads the report.

// CompatOptions configures RunCompat.
type CompatOptions struct {
	// Claude is the candidate binary: an absolute path. It is launched by that
	// path — resolved through symlinks first — and never looked up on PATH,
	// because a login shell's PATH would silently put the installed build back
	// in front of the candidate.
	Claude string
	// Only restricts the run to these check IDs (already validated by the
	// caller, or refused here). Empty runs every check.
	Only []string
	// PackDir, when set, receives the raw evidence each check produced.

	// cannot be influenced by the machine it runs on.
	Getenv func(string) string
}

// RunCompat checks the candidate and returns the schema 1 report.
//
// The error is for an invocation that cannot be run at all — the path is not
// an absolute path to an executable file, or --only names a check this build
// has no implementation for. Those produce no report. Every other problem,
// including a candidate that cannot be identified or an isolated multiplexer
// that cannot start, is a REPORT whose checks are error:true, because "could
// not run" must reach the caller as something it can retry, not as a
// disappearing act.
//
// A non-nil error may accompany a non-zero report: a --pack that could not be
// written is reported as an error, but never hides the verdict it belongs to.
