// Session naming, owned by this driver.
//
// # Why the rules live here rather than in a client
//
// They were previously applied by the on-machine launcher and by nothing else.
// A session created through the API took `spec.Name` verbatim, so three things
// diverged at once: a name the launcher would have rewritten was accepted
// as-is, a name that collided was a hard failure where the launcher would have
// numbered it, and the result carried no type marker, so tooling that keys on
// one saw a different shape.
//
// Rules applied by whichever client got there first are not rules; they are a
// convention that holds until a second client exists. This driver is the one
// place every creation path passes through, so it is where they belong. A
// client MAY pre-sanitize — it will get the same answer, because these
// functions are idempotent — but it is no longer the only thing standing
// between a bad name and the multiplexer.
//
// # The invariant that matters most
//
// The resolved name is used for the multiplexer session, for the remote-control
// binding, and for the agent's own name — the SAME string in all three places,
// from birth. Those three drifting apart is what makes a session unreachable
// from a remote client while still looking healthy locally, and it is not
// something a caller can repair afterwards.

// nameBody is the alphabet a sanitized name is built from. It is deliberately
// the LOWERCASE ASCII set plus three separators: not because other characters
// are rejected, but because this set defines what counts as decoration below.

// sanitizeName removes what the multiplexer cannot hold, and nothing else.
//
// A denylist rather than an allowlist, which is safe here for a specific
// reason: names reach the multiplexer and the agent bound as ARGV, never
// spliced into a shell command string (see loginWrap), so an arbitrary
// printable byte is not an injection risk on the create path. Narrowing to an
// allowlist would instead break every name carrying a non-ASCII marker, which
// is most of them.
//
// Each removal has a cause:
//
//   - control characters: unrepresentable, and they corrupt the field-separated
//     enumeration this driver parses.
//   - ':' — the multiplexer's own target separator, so a name containing one
//     addresses something else.
//   - '.' becomes '-', because the multiplexer silently mangles '.' to '_' and
//     a name that changes underneath you is worse than one you chose.
//   - a LEADING '-', which any argv parser downstream reads as a flag.

// The question has three real answers, not two. applyMarker used to
// collapse "confirmed absent" and "no idea, guess from the string" into one
// path, because a string is all it had. A session record (reconcile.go's
// sessionRecord) can now say which of the two it actually is, for any

// adopted session, a foreign one, a cold store), markerUnknown falls back
// to exactly the string heuristic this driver already had.

// second preserves the older rule that a name already outside the nameBody
