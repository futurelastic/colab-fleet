// Event subscription over the multiplexer's control mode.
//
// # What the substrate actually offers, measured
//
// Control mode is a real push channel — no polling, notifications arrive
// sub-second. But its scoping is not what a naive reading assumes, and the
// difference decides the whole design. Probed directly:
//
//	%output for the ATTACHED session ........................ delivered
//	%output for a sibling session .......................... NOT delivered
//	%subscription-changed (refresh-client -B, %pane) ....... attached only
//	%subscription-changed targeting a sibling's pane by id . NOT delivered
//	%sessions-changed / %unlinked-window-add / -close ...... DELIVERED (global)
//
// So content events are per-attachment and lifecycle events are global.
// That asymmetry is the entire architecture:
//
//   - ONE always-on control client yields every session appearing and
//     disappearing, fleet-wide, regardless of which session it is attached
//     to.
//   - Content changes need a client attached to the session in question, so
//     those are opened on demand — when a req subscribes — and reaped on
//     unsubscribe. Cost is O(subscribers), typically one or two, rather than
//     O(sessions).
//
// The rejected alternative was a client per session at startup. It works and
// it is simpler, but it restores exactly the per-session process cost the
// batched enumeration exists to avoid, and it buys fidelity nobody asked
// for: %output is a raw byte firehose, and this driver does not want bytes.
//
// Verified separately, because it would have been disqualifying: attaching a
// control client does NOT renegotiate the session's size. A session created
// at 200x50 measured 200x50 before attach, during attach, and after detach.
// Subscribing to somebody's live session does not reflow their terminal.
//
// # Push-triggered pull
//
// Notifications are used only as CHANGE TRIGGERS. When one arrives, this
// code re-runs the ordinary batched enumeration and diffs the result. It
// never parses %output's payload to infer what happened.
//
// That is deliberate, and it is not the polling §5.5 forbids: reads are
// edge-triggered by the substrate, never timer-triggered. Nothing wakes up
// on an interval, and an idle fleet costs nothing. What it buys is that
// exactly one code path decides what a session's state is — the same
// classifier List and State use. A second, stream-only interpretation of
// pane bytes would be a second source of truth about status, free to drift
// from the first, and the two would disagree only under load, which is when
// anybody would care.
//
// # FINDING: Event carries fields a driver cannot fill
//
// fleet.Event has Cursor and Epoch, which §7.3 defines as assigned by "each
// service instance" — a driver has no access to either, and two drivers
// under one service must not be minting competing cursor sequences. This
// driver therefore leaves both zero and the service is expected to stamp
// them on the way out. Recorded because the type's shape implies drivers
// fill it in, and any driver that tried would be wrong in a way that only
// shows up as a subscriber silently missing a resync.

// forever, with a full enumeration behind each one. That is the re-dial storm the
// rejected option was rejected for, arriving by a different route, so it is
// bounded here rather than argued away.
//
// The budget is renewable, and what renews it is the only evidence available
// without consulting a clock: a client that delivered at least one notification
// demonstrably worked, so its eventual death is an ordinary session exit and
// costs nothing. Only CONSECUTIVE silent attempts count against the budget.

// reaped.
//
// The engine's diff covers the plain case: a read that finds the session
// gone calls detachContent, which closes the client. It covers nothing a read
// does not SEE. A session that exits and is re-created under the same id
// between two reads is never observed to close, so its dead client stayed in
// s.conns — a zombie process until the subscription itself closed (measured
// on a real multiplexer: the kill-only case was already reaped, the
// kill-and-recreate case was not). Only this goroutine knows the client died,
// so the reap belongs here rather than in the diff.
//
// Reaping alone left the second half of that case open (#172): the id stays in
// the engine's `known` map, so the diff's !had branch — the only thing that opens
// a content client — never fires for the new incarnation, and the session keeps
// its place in the feed while silently losing its own push triggers. Before the
// reap this was invisible, because the dead client sat in s.conns and the gap
// looked like a live attachment. So this goroutine also leaves the re-attach mark
// the next read acts on; see reattachState.
//
// Bounded where the lifecycle one was not (at most maxContentClients per
// subscription), but not harmless: a dead entry also holds one of those
// slots.
//
// Cancellation is not a death: the stream's own Close cancels first and then
// reaps every client it holds, so returning here avoids a second Close on the
// same shutdown path. Every other return — the session exited, or
// detachContent already closed the client — removes the entry only if it
// still points at THIS client, since the session may have been re-attached
