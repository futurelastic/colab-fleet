//
//	D1  landed-check false negative on Claude Code's own word-wrap  -> confirmLandedV2 (this file)
//	D2  non-bracketed paste, CR-converted, swallows/splits          -> pasteBracketed (this file)
//	D3  long single-line pastes collapse/drop bytes                 -> pasteBracketed uses -p -r (no CR conversion, no chunk boundary this driver introduces)
//	D4  no per-session serialisation                                -> terminalpath2_lock.go
//	D5  stranded-record lifecycle gaps                               -> terminalpath2_stranded.go

// This file holds the two D1/D2 fixes: bracketed, literal-newline delivery
// (replacing the CR-converting, non-bracketed paste-buffer call D2 names),
// and a composer-region-scoped, wrap-tolerant landed confirmation (replacing
// the raw-capture 24-byte-tail substring match D1 names).

// sanitizeForBracketedPaste strips bytes that could otherwise let the
// PAYLOAD end the bracket-paste sequence early — an embedded literal
// ESC[201~ (the bracketed-paste END marker) in a message this driver pastes
// would, if delivered unmodified, close the bracket ahead of schedule and
// leave the remainder of the message interpreted as ordinary (unbracketed)
// terminal input instead of pasted text. That is an injection: the payload
// would be deciding, mid-delivery, that the rest of itself is no longer a
// paste.
//
// ESC (0x1B) is dropped outright rather than merely refused-on-detection,
// because a caller has no legitimate reason to deliver a raw escape byte
// through this path — every documented reason to affect the runtime by key
// name goes through Keys (fleet.KeyName), never through Send's text.
//
// Every other C0 control byte (0x00-0x1F) is dropped too, except the two
// this driver's own delivery shape depends on: \n (the payload's own line
// breaks — the entire point of asking tmux for literal newlines with -r
// instead of the old CR-converting default) and \t (an ordinary character a
// human or an agent may legitimately type). \r is deliberately NOT kept: it
// is not content, and letting it through would reintroduce exactly the
// "did the multiplexer just turn a payload byte into an Enter-equivalent"
// ambiguity this whole change exists to remove — see -r's own semantics
// (tmux(1): "-r causes tmux to send \r rather than \n to the pane"), which
// is why this driver asks for -r AND never emits a \r of its own into the
// buffer it hands tmux.
//
// DEL (0x7F) is dropped for the same reason as the other C0 controls: it is
// a control code by convention even though it sits outside the 0x00-0x1F
// block.

// arrives as "\n", not as the CR D2 measured being read as Enter mid-payload
// (9/9 labelled sends swallowing their own first line; 27/27 short
// multi-line payloads splitting/early-submitting).
//
// # Why this refuses rather than falling back to the old paste on flag=0
//
// The task that asked for this file was explicit: falling back silently
// reintroduces D2 exactly on the pane where this driver could not first
// confirm the runtime asked for bracketed mode — the one case the fallback
// would be exercised on is the one case nobody could have tested it against,
// because #{bracket_paste_flag} said no. Round-1's own measurement is that
// every live Claude Code pane sampled reported bracket_paste_flag=1, so this
// refusal is expected to fire on live traffic approximately never; it exists
// for a pane whose occupant never asked for bracketed mode — a case where
// guessing which delivery shape is safe is exactly the guess this driver's
// own §2.4/§5.6 discipline (fail closed, never emulate) refuses elsewhere.
//
// It is NOT protection against a shell: an interactive shell turns bracketed
// paste on at its own prompt (measured, #180 H2), so the flag reads 1 there
// too. What stops a paste reaching a shell is foregroundIsRuntime
// (foreground.go), checked before this is ever called.
//
// The alternative considered and rejected: keep the old call as a fallback
// gated on flag=0. Rejected because nothing in this codebase, before this
// change, measured what flag=0 actually looks like on a real Claude Code
// pane (round-1 measured only flag=1), so a fallback branch would be
// deploying UNMEASURED behaviour disguised as graceful degradation — the
// same shape of mistake §5.6's "degrade, never emulate" already names.
