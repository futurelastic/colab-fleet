// Peer down state (muster #237).
//
// # The defect this closes
//
// A peer that sleeps overnight stops answering, and until this state existed
// every read that reached it re-dialled a machine already known to be gone and
// waited the full bound (the dialer's own timeout, ~30s). The whole fleet read
// therefore took ~30s, and so did anything with a shorter HTTP timeout — which
// just failed. Nothing remembered that the last thousand calls had failed.
//
// # The rule
//
// After downAfterFailures CONSECUTIVE genuine transport failures the peer is
// marked down. While it is down, a call that would have dialled it fails at
// once with the same `unreachable` a timeout produces — the wire shape is
// unchanged, only the wait is gone — and the error names when the peer began
// failing. A background probe (GET /v1/health) re-asks on a doubling backoff
// and clears the state on the FIRST answer of any kind. Any answer from the
// peer clears it too, whichever path it arrived on.
//
// The backoff has the shape of internal/delivery/modclient's supervisor
// (double each miss, capped), reused rather than reinvented; the constants
// differ because a peer that wakes should be noticed within a minute, not
// treated like a crashing child.
//
// # What counts as a failure — and what deliberately does not
//
//   - A caller that hung up (context.Canceled) says nothing about the peer.
//   - A call the CALLER shortened below this driver's own bound (§4.4's
//     Fleet-Deadline-Ms) and that then missed that shorter deadline says
//     nothing either: the peer may well have been answering, just not inside
//     a budget someone else chose (#174). Counting those would let one
//     impatient client mark a healthy, slow peer down for everyone.
//   - Any HTTP response, whatever its status, is an answer: the peer is up.
//
// # What it costs, said plainly
//
// While a peer is marked down, calls to it — mutations included — fail fast
// instead of being attempted. A false positive therefore blocks a send for at
// most downBackoffMax. It is the right trade for a peer that stops answering
// for hours, and the failure it produces is the honest, retryable
// `unreachable` a timeout would have produced anyway, only sooner and without
// the ambiguity of a request that might have been half-delivered.

	// downAfterFailures is K: consecutive genuine transport failures before
